The way software development teams organize themselves changed significantly over the last couple of decades. While the ultimate goal has always been the delivery of value for their customers and the business, the bottleneck impeding their effectiveness and efficiency has been changing over time.

In the 00's the focus moved to becoming lean and agile to fix the bottlenecks in software development. In the 10's the focus moved to improving the flow from development to operations to fix the bottlenecks in software release.

In the 20's the bottleneck is no longer the same. The teams no longer need to obsess with an inward look of their structure and cycles in isolation because the industry has already gathered sufficient knowledge and experience on this matter. Instead the teams should move their focus on the now more significant impediment - staying relevant.
