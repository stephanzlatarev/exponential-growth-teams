The way software development teams organize themselves changed significantly over the last couple of decades. While the ultimate goal has always been the delivery of value for their customers and the business, the bottleneck impeding their effectiveness and efficiency has been changing over time.

In the 00's the focus moved to becoming lean and agile to fix the bottlenecks in software development. In the 10's the focus moved to improving the flow from development to operations to fix the bottlenecks in software release.

In the 20's the bottleneck is no longer the same. The teams no longer need to obsess with an inward look of their structure and cycles in isolation because the industry has already gathered sufficient knowledge and experience on this matter. Instead the teams should move their focus on the now more significant impediment - staying relevant.

Nowadays markets are moving fast and company shareholders expect healthy growth - preferably in the double-digit range. It is necessary for every unit in the organization to contribute to the exponential growth of their company, or otherwise expect to soon be replaced by another that can.

But, how to become an exponential growth team? Or even, is it possible for every team to be one?

Let's examine one way to do it...

# The exponential growth team

The exponential growth team is still a DevOps team. It is still lean and agile. It still prioritizes on customer focus and quality. In addition, it has **focus** on **one objective** with **exponential growth** potential. This is the major difference and it ensures the success of the team is bound to exponential value-add growth.

The exponential growth team acknowledges that its product or service is as good as its hardware and software, people who develop it and people who operate it, work together. Thus, it takes a holistic approach designing the system including all of them to optimize for the exponential growth objective.

The exponential growth team has only two tasks:
 * Select its exponential growth objective
 * Design its business system to scale

# The exponential growth objective

Selection of the exponential growth objective considers the following aspects:
 * Top priority - There is only one exponential growth objective for the team and it is the highest priority in every decision and also the thing that aligns all members and activities
 * Measurable (Can we objectively measure it?)
 * Desirable (Do we want to grw exponentially like this?)
 * Feasible (Is it possible to grow exponentially like this?)
 * Viable (Can we automate our business system to scale like this?)

# The business system

Design of the business system considers the following aspects:
 * It is a complex system of human operators and machine units where each of them is viewed as linear, i.e. has linear output with specified quality
 * The quality specifications for each linear unit (i.e. the operational objectives) directly and indirectly support the exponential growth objective

# Deep dive in the works of the exponential growth team

The exponential growth team is small because its tasks are only a few and they are very focused. Only the people that are interested in selecting the exponential growth objective and in designing the business system are considered part of the team. It is desirable that the whole development and operations team participates but in practice this usually does not happen.

The exponential growth team meets in:
 * Regular (e.g. bi-weekly) meetings to run the selection and design process. The meetings should have agenda:
   1. Evaluate the current list of exponential growth objectives
   2. Select the exponential growth objective
   3. Assess the current design of the business system by the selected objective
   4. Design changes to improve the business system
   5. Plan the implementation of the changes
 * Ad-hoc (i.e. whenever necessary) meetings with human operators and machine units from the business system to introduce the planned changes in the design

The exponential growth team maintains the following artefacts visible to all stakeholders:
 * 1 exponential growth objective, supported with:
 ** (real-time) measurement of the objective
 ** a set of expected milestones - expected measurements in future points in time
 * 1 design of the business system, supported with:
 ** (real-time) measurements of the linear indicators and deviations
